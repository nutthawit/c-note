// A union is a special data type that can store different data types at the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple purposes. A unionâ€™s size will be the size of the largest constituent type.

#include <stdio.h>

union my_data {
  int i;
  float f;
  char str[20];
};

int main() {
  union my_data obj1;
  printf("Size of my_data union: %lu\n", sizeof(obj1));
  return 0;
  // outout: Size of my_data union: 20
}
